# 🏢 HR & Payroll Management Platform (MVP)

A streamlined, two-sided web platform designed to eliminate administrative chaos for small business owners and provide complete transparency for employees.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview & Problem Statement

### **The Problem**

Small businesses often manage employee records, payroll, and leave through spreadsheets, paper, and informal communication. This makes payroll information difficult to understand, leave balances difficult to track, and forces employees to repeatedly contact HR for routine information, creating unnecessary workload and confusion.

### **The Solution**

A two-sided web platform where HR ("Ada") manages payroll, records, and leave centrally, and employees ("Tunde") can see a clearly explained breakdown of their own pay and leave without asking anyone.

## ⚙️ MVP Scope & Architecture

To prevent scope creep, our MVP is strictly bounded into a laser-focused structure: **4 Epics, 15 Features, and 42 User Stories**.

- **Epic 1: Employee Management (12 User Stories)**
  - Managing employee records, profiles, directories, searches, employment information, and active/inactive statuses.
- **Epic 2: Payroll Management (14 User Stories)**
  - Salary configurations, deduction mappings, core payroll calculation engine, review/finalization workflows, payslip generation, history, and payment statuses. _(Note: Automated government tax/pension integrations are excluded from the MVP)_.
- **Epic 3: Leave Management (8 User Stories)**
  - Leave entitlements, balance tracking, automated day-count calculations, request submissions with automatic balance deductions, and admin approval/rejection workflows with automatic balance refunds.
- **Epic 4: Employee Self-Service & Communication (8 User Stories)**
  - Employee dashboard summaries, the "Ask HR" direct messaging system (`/api/messages/to-hr`), two-way HR inbox management, and company-wide announcement broadcasts.

## 👥 Team Structure & Sub-Teams

Our 7 backend developers are divided into 3 specialized sub-teams led by Godis Akachukwu to build the platform efficiently without Git merge conflicts:

- **Sub-Team 1: Foundation, Security & Core Tech (2 Developers)**
  - Handles Node.js/Express server setup, MongoDB connections, JWT Authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and global supporting utilities.
- **Sub-Team 2: Employee & Payroll Management - Epics 1 & 2 (3 Developers - Lead by Team Lead)**
  - Handles the employee directory, profile management, salary configurations, deduction engines, and the core payroll calculation and payslip generation workflows.
- **Sub-Team 3: Leave, Self-Service & Communication - Epics 3 & 4 (2 Developers)**
  - Handles leave balances, request/refund workflows, employee dashboard aggregations, and the two-way messaging communication systems.

  # Sub-Team 1: Foundation, Auth & Core Tech

Handles server setup, database connection, JWT authentication, Role-Based Access Control (Admin/Employee), and shared utilities (search, notifications) for the HR & Payroll Management Platform MVP.

## Tech Stack

Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB & Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in your own values
3. `npm run dev`
4. Confirm "MongoDB connected" and "Server live on port 5000"

## Roles

`Admin`, `Employee`

## Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/auth/me` (requires token)
- `GET /api/auth/admin-only` (requires token + Admin role)
- `GET /api/notifications` (requires token)
- `GET /api/search/employees?name=` (requires token)

## Using the middleware in your routes

```javascript
const authMiddleware = require("../middleware/auth");
const requireRole = require("../middleware/roleCheck");

router.post("/some-route", authMiddleware, requireRole("Admin"), controllerFn);
```

## Folder structure

config/ - database connection
models/ - schemas
controllers/ - request logic
routes/ - URL mapping
middleware/ - auth & role checks

## 🔄 Core Product Flow

1. **HR Record Creation:** Ada creates employee records and sets up employment/salary data.
2. **Payroll Execution:** Ada runs payroll calculations and finalizes records, generating official payslips.
3. **Self-Service Access:** Tunde logs into his dashboard to view his profile, current salary breakdown, leave balance, and payslips instantly.
4. **Human Fallback:** If self-service isn't enough, Tunde contacts HR via the dedicated "Ask HR" routing endpoint, and Ada responds from a centralized inbox.

## 🛠️ Key API Endpoints Built & Tested

- **Authentication (`/api/users`):** Secure user registration and login with JWT token issuance and RBAC.
- **Employee Management (`/api/employees`):** Creation and directory listing of employee profiles (Admin/HR protected).
- **Leave Lifecycle (`/api/leaves`):**
  - `POST /api/leaves` - Applies for leave, validates available balance, and automatically deducts days.
  - `PATCH /api/leaves/:id/status` - Admin route to approve or reject requests; automatically refunds leave days back to the employee upon rejection.
- **Salary & Payroll (`/api/salary` & `/api/payroll`):** Configuration of base salaries and generation of automated gross/net pay calculations.
- **Messaging & HR Inquiries (`/api/messages`):**
  - `POST /api/messages/to-hr` - Automatic routing of employee inquiries straight to management.
  - `POST /api/messages` - Direct messaging from HR back to employees.
  - `GET /api/messages` - Centralized inbox retrieval.
